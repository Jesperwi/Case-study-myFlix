    <div class="Wrap">
      <div class="firstWrap">
        <h3 class="header">Overview</h3>
          <p class="info">myFlix is a web app that I developed using React. 
            The site provides the user with information about movies, genres and directors. 
            It’s meant to be used to let users create an account and update their personal data. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="secondWrap">
      <h3 class="header">Purpose and Context</h3>
        <p class="info">myFlix was a project I made during the full-stack developer course at CareerFoundry to
            try and learn the front-end and the backend of programming using different frameworks and libraries.  </p>
    </div>
      <div class="thirdWrap">
        <h3 class="header">Objective</h3>
            <p class="info"> My objective was to make this an app that I could present to my employer since it involves
              both frontend work and backend. The problem I faced was to properly get the server side working with the 
              frontend. </p>

    <h3 class="header1">Approach</h3>
      <p class="aInfo">To retrieve data from the database CRUD methods were used. The database is created with the help of NODE.js and Express that will interact with MongoDB which I first create locally. To test the API I used Postman. Here I also created an JWT authentication for the user to log in with that is safe and secure. 
        After making the API, I started to build the interface where the endpoints 
        will be requested. I made it into a single page which has been developed with React and React-Redux. It has a login in feature that saves the users information which they will be able to update. A main view that will provide us with a list of all the movies, but also a single movie view, 
        genre view and a director view. There is also a Profile view to see the users information. </p>

    <h3 class="header1">Challenges</h3>
      <p class="info">This was the most challenging project I had to do since
        React can be a quite difficult language to learn. But after learning 
        it and understanding it’s basics I found that it is a very effective
          framework. Developing the API with node.js and express was quite the 
          challenge but I managed to find a good tutorial online and with the help
          study material. After a meeting with a friend I manage to solve the endpoint issues I had to show the API on the front end of things. It was a really good project to do and I learned  a lot of new things. 
      </p>

    <h3 class="header1">Duration</h3>
      <p class="info">This project took about 4 weeks since I’ve never used React or 
        Mongodb but it was neccassary to be able to learn everything I had to learn.</p>
